# StreamPipes k8s - The Operator's Dream
StreamPipes k8s is a helm chart to deploy StreamPipes on Kubernetes.

<!-- BEGIN do not edit: set via ../upgrade_versions.sh -->
**Current version:** 0.67.0
<!-- END do not edit -->

## Prerequisite
Requires Helm (https://helm.sh/) and an active connection to a kubernetes cluster with a running tiller server.

Tested with:
* K3s v1.18.8+k3s1 (6b595318) with K8s v1.18.8
* Helm v3.1.2

## Usage
We provide two helm chart options to get you going:

- **default**: a light-weight option with few pipeline elements, needs less memory
- **full**:  contains more pipeline elements, requires **>16 GB RAM** (recommended)

**Starting** the **default** helm chart option is as easy as simply running the following command from the root of this folder:
> **NOTE**: Starting might take a while since we also initially pull all Docker images from Dockerhub.

```bash
helm install streampipes ./
```
After a while, all containers should successfully started, indicated by the `Running` status. 
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-66d58f47cf-2r2nb                      1/1     Running   0          3m27s
backend-76ddc486c8-nswpc                       1/1     Running   0          3m27s
connect-master-7b477f9b79-8dfvr                1/1     Running   0          3m26s
connect-worker-78d89c989c-9v8zs                1/1     Running   0          3m27s
consul-55965f966b-gwb7l                        1/1     Running   0          3m27s
couchdb-77db98cf7b-xnnvb                       1/1     Running   0          3m27s
influxdb-b95b6479-r8wh8                        1/1     Running   0          3m27s
kafka-657b5fb77-dp2d6                          1/1     Running   0          3m27s
pipeline-elements-all-jvm-79c445dbd9-m8xcs     1/1     Running   0          3m27s
sources-watertank-simulator-6c6b8844f6-6b4d7   1/1     Running   0          3m27s
ui-b94bd9766-rm6zb                             2/2     Running   0          3m27s
zookeeper-5d9947686f-6nzgs                     1/1     Running   0          3m26s
```

After all containers are successfully started just got to your browser and visit any of the k8s cluster nodes on
`http://<NODE_IP>` to finish the installation.

> **NOTE**: If you're running Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows with a local k8s cluster, the above step to use your host IP might not work. Luckily, you can port-forward a service port to your localhost using the following command to be able to access the UI either via `http://localhost` or `http://<HOST_IP>` (you require sudo to run this command in order to bind to a privileged port).
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ui --address=0.0.0.0 80:80
```

Starting the **full** helm chart option is almost the same:
```bash
helm install streampipes ./ --set deployment=full
```

**Deleting** the current helm chart deployment:
```bash
helm del streampipes
```

## Troubleshooting
### Some of the Deployments Never Reach 'Ready' State
#### ui
The UI Deployment specifies so-called init containers which wait for the following deployments:
* backend
* connect-master
* consul
* couchdb
* activemq

This means that when at least one of these deployments are not reachable the containers running the UI will not start up. Chances are when you fix the issues with the the others it will start up fine.

#### backend
##### Multi-Attach Error
###### Problem
`kubectl describe pod <backend-pod-name>` shows the following message:

```Multi-Attach error for volume "pvc-xxx-xxx" Volume is already exclusively attached to one node and can't be attached to another```

The issue is that the 'backend' Deployment and the 'pipeline-elements-all-jvm' are specified to use the same PersistentVolume. For this to be possible without restrictions, the used StorageClass (which defaults to your cluster 'default') needs to create PersistentVolumes which are set to "ReadWriteMany". This means that the same volume can be accessed by multiple Nodes of the Kubernetes cluster. 

If you see this error then your 'default' StorageClass does not fulfill those requirements.

###### Solution
The easiest way would be to switch to a StorageClass which allows for "ReadWriteMany" if possible.

If that is not possible assign the Pods of the two Deployments (backend and pipeline-elements-all-jvm) to be always deployed on the same Node. For one way to do so see the Kubernetes documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/)
